= Introduction

The Clojurephant Tooling API (link:https://github.com/clojurephant/clojurephant-tooling[GitHub Repo]) is a sibling project to xref:clojurephant::index.adoc[Clojurephant], the Gradle plugin providing support for Clojure and ClojureScript builds.

This library is meant for use from a Clojure REPL to interact with a Gradle project using Clojurephant.

CAUTION: The features and API should not be considered stable until 1.0.0.

== Features

* General Clojure wrapper for link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/third_party_integration.html[Gradle's Tooling API]
* Access to Clojurephant's Gradle configuration from the REPL
* Compile ClojureScript builds (including in watch mode)
* Start ClojureScript REPLs based on:
** Figwheel Main - with full hot code reloading
** Figwheel REPL - for a more tranditional workflow, evaluating forms
