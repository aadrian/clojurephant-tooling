== What is this?

A library to interact with Gradle's link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/third_party_integration.html[Tooling API]. This means you can run tasks and inspect a Gradle project from Clojure code, most interestingly the REPL.

In practice, this is targeted mainly as a REPL-helper library for link:https://github.com/clojurephant/clojurephant[clojurephant] users.

* Run ClojureScript builds
* Start ClojureScript REPLs
** Browser REPL
* Run arbitrary Gradle tasks

IMPORTANT: Currently requires un-released clojurephant features to function.

== Why should you care?

Since clojurephant's goal is to provide a Gradle-native experience, but with the creature comforts of a Clojure environment, we want to make it easy to reuse your Gradle configuration to perform tasks in the REPL.

Most importantly this helps configure ClojureScript REPLs properly to use the classpath and configuration from your Gradle project.

== Usage

See the link:https://github.com/clojurephant/clojurephant-tooling/releases[Release Notes] for available versions, compatibility with clojurephant versions, and detailed change notes.
